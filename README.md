<h3>About Me</h3>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about data analysis and always seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in projects that make a real impact.

I'm currently completing my studies as a Software Developer while pursuing a self-taught specialization in Data Science. Along the way, I have gained a solid foundation in statistics, mathematics, and programming, which has enabled me to tackle challenges involving data collection, cleaning, and analysis.

I have had the opportunity to participate in projects that have not only strengthened my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to solve complex problems and communicate key insights through effective visualizations.

With a constant focus on learning and adapting to new technologies, my goal is to continue exploring and applying innovative solutions in the field of data analytics. I am excited to collaborate in dynamic teams and contribute my passion and knowledge to meaningful projects.
